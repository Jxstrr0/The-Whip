# The Whip - Progress

The running log of what each build session finished, written for Kelbo in plain language. Newest entry at the bottom.

## 2026-10-21 · Stage 0: repo and pipeline

**What was built**

- `DESIGN.md` and `HANDOFF.md` committed from the two docs.
- `index.html` with the phone viewport tag, the Three.js `0.160.0` import map, and a full-screen canvas that ignores browser touch gestures so the game can use them.
- A placeholder scene: a slowly turning oak-and-green-leather desk under soft light, with the title underneath.
- `css/style.css` (dark theme, safe-area padding for notched phones), `src/main.js`, `.nojekyll`, `README.md` with the live link, and this file.

**Things to know**

- The repo is named `The-Whip` (capital T and W), so the live URL is **https://jxstrr0.github.io/The-Whip/**, not `/the-whip/` as the handoff says. Use the link in the README so the case matches the repo name.

**What you need to do in GitHub**

1. Open the repo, go to **Settings → Pages**.
2. Under **Build and deployment**, set Source to **Deploy from a branch**, pick **`main`** and **`/ (root)`**, and save.
3. Wait a minute or two, then open the live URL on your phone.

## 2026-10-21 · Stage 1: the chamber

**What was built**

- `src/chamber/layout.js`: pure maths for all 120 seats (side, row, seat number, position, facing). Seats `s001`–`s060` are the government side (the Speaker's right), `s061`–`s120` the opposition.
- `src/chamber/scene.js`: the room itself in simple shapes: green carpet, stepped rows, stone walls with tall windows, oak panelling, galleries along both long walls, the Speaker's dais and canopied chair, the Clerk's table with the Mace, and the brass bar.
- `src/chamber/seats.js`: every desk and chair drawn as one batch each (instancing), paired desks, and a pulsing gold ring on the selected seat.
- `src/chamber/camera.js`: one finger orbits (limited to ±60° sideways, 30°–75° from overhead), pinch zooms between 6 and 26 m, double-tap eases in to frame the seats around where you tapped. Mouse drag and wheel work on a computer.
- `src/chamber/picking.js`: a tap finds the seat under your thumb and shows a label with its id, side, row and seat number.
- `src/kit3d.js`: small shared helpers for building rooms out of boxes (not in the handoff's file list; the office, riding and caucus rooms will reuse it).

**Checks**

- Tested in a headless phone browser (Pixel 7 size, portrait and landscape): every on-screen seat was tapped and reported the right id (90 of 90; the other 30 are off the edge of a portrait screen until you turn the camera). Orbit, pinch and double-tap focus all respect the limits. No console errors.
- The whole chamber draws in 6 draw calls (budget is 60).
- **Still for you:** check it feels smooth on your phone with `?debug=1` (FPS counter, bottom left). The pixel ratio is capped at 2.

**Things to know / decisions I made**

- **Row spacing.** The handoff starts row 1 at 2.0 m from the aisle's edge, but four rows at 1.3 m spacing from there would put row 4 outside the 15 m-wide floor. I started row 1 at 1.0 m instead, which keeps the floor size and still clears the aisle. One number in `layout.js` if you want to change it.
- **Default camera outside the room.** The handoff's default camera spot (0, 9, 19) is outside the bar-end wall (the floor ends at 13). The walls and ceiling are one-sided, so you see straight through them from outside; nothing blocks the view.
- **Portrait lens.** On a portrait phone the camera widens its lens (up to 75°) so both sides of the aisle fit, instead of backing further out.

## 2026-10-21 · Stage 2: MPs, parties, cohorts and cliques

**What was built**

- `src/sim/rng.js`: the seeded random number generator. Every random thing in the game comes from the seed, so `?seed=TEST-1` is the same Parliament on every phone, every time.
- `src/sim/generate.js`: a whole Parliament from a seed. It holds an election (who governs, seat counts within the handoff's ranges, usually a minority), picks 120 ridings from the riding pool by province, decides which party wins which riding by geography and ideology, and generates every MP (name, age, riding, margin, cohort, loyalty, ambition, ideology, interests, committee, attendance, secrets). It also appoints leaders, House Leaders, whips, cabinet or critics, parliamentary secretaries, committee chairs and the Speaker.
- `src/sim/relationships.js`: cliques (regional caucuses, ideological wings, a leadership contender's camp and social crowds, up to four per caucus), friend and rival links, and mentors for most rookies. It also holds the rules for broken promises spreading through a cohort and clique, and for your reputation style. Those get used from stage 4.
- `src/sim/knowledge.js`: what you know about each MP. A fresh game shows only name, party, riding and seat. Everything else is "Unknown" until you learn it, and goes faded ("stale") after 26 weeks without contact.
- `src/chamber/layout.js` now seats the House: government on the Speaker's right, each party as one block, leaders and cabinet in the front row, the Chief Whip in row 2 behind the House Leader with the Deputy beside them, assistant whips at the ends of rows 1, 3 and 4, and cliques sitting together.
- `src/chamber/mps3d.js`: all MPs drawn in their party colours (two draw calls), with a gold outline on the one you tap. The Speaker sits in the chair.
- `src/ui/mpCard.js`: tap an MP for their card. `src/ui/book.js`: the whip's book, with all 120 MPs, search, filters (party, clique, cohort, riding type) and sorting.
- `src/state.js`, `src/sim/modes.js` (new game), `src/sim/career.js` (the player becomes a rookie in their party), `data/*.json` (names, 172 ridings, parties, cliques, backgrounds, tuning, UI strings), and `tests.html`.

**Checks**

- `tests.html`: 13 of 13 pass. Seed TEST-1 gives the same hash every time and in every browser. All five parties are present. Seat counts match. The whips, cabinet and cliques sit where the spec says. TEST-1 is a minority with no overflow. SEED-17 is a majority with 3 government MPs across the aisle at the bar end. A fresh card shows only the public facts. Knowledge goes stale after 26 weeks.
- In the phone browser, tapping an MP opens their card. The book's search, filters and sort work, and tapping a name flies the camera to that MP's block.

**Things to know / decisions I made**

- **The Speaker is one of the 120 MPs**, usually a senior government member. They leave their desk for the chair, so 119 desks are filled and one stays empty.
- **When the government has fewer than 60 seats**, the opposition can't all fit on its own side. The handoff only covers the reverse case. I used the Canadian practice: the leftover opposition members (smallest parties and independents) sit in the government side's back rows nearest the bar.
- **Party blocks run along the chamber, not across it.** Each party fills seat columns from the Speaker's end, front row to back, so every party is a solid block of colour. The "row 2, seat 1" whip seats are counted from the start of each party's own block.
- **Role titles are public.** The card shows titles like "Chief Whip" or "Minister" from day one, because you need to know who your whip is. All personal attributes start hidden.
- **Unique names.** No two MPs share a first or a last name, so the House is easier to tell apart on a small screen.

## 2026-10-21 · Stage 3: votes, divisions and pacing

**What was built**

- `src/sim/bills.js`: the four kinds of business (government bills, private members' bills, opposition motions, supply), and the readings: first reading, second reading, committee (where members add amendments, usually money for their own ridings), report stage (where the opposition moves floor amendments, which sometimes carry in a minority), and third reading. Each party sets a position and decides whether to whip it. Governments bring bills that suit them, and some social bills get free votes. On confidence votes, parties weigh whether an election would suit them. Supply follows a yearly calendar (Throne Speech reply, budget, estimates).
- `src/sim/mp.js`: the decision model from the design doc. Each MP weighs the party line (scaled by loyalty), ideology, what the bill does for their riding, promises and how they feel about the whip and leader, friends, their clique, any pressure, and what it costs them with voters (worse in a marginal seat), plus a little noise. Attendance is rolled separately.
- `src/sim/vote.js`: the Speaker puts the question. If fewer than five members rise against the voices, it's settled on a voice vote. Otherwise there's a recorded division: standing members only, pairs honoured, and a tie goes to the Speaker, who follows the real convention (yes at second reading and report stage, to allow more debate; no on final questions).
- `src/sim/pacing.js`: the day loop (morning, caucus, House, office, fallout, weekend). Routine days settle themselves into one-line summaries. The game stops you only for your own dilemma votes (a whipped vote your riding or conscience pulls against) and confidence votes. **Continue** goes to the next stop of any kind. **⏭ Skip** jumps to the next thing that actually needs you.
- `src/chamber/voteLights.js`: during a division, absent MPs leave their seats, then the yeas light up seat by seat followed by the nays. Each seat shows a check, a cross or a dash, so votes read without colour. Paired seats pulse white.
- `src/ui/countBoard.js`: the bells sheet, with your party's line, how your riding and conscience feel, and three choices: vote with the party, break with the line, or be somewhere else. You have 15 or 30 real seconds; when the doors close, you're in your seat voting with the party. After that comes the live tally by party against the number needed.
- `src/ui/agenda.js`: the bottom bar with the date, latest news, Continue and Skip. Tap the date for the feed. It also shows the morning order paper and a weekly review.
- The whip's book gains an "at risk" sort for the next vote. `?debug=1` now has tuning sliders for every number in `data/tuning.json`.

**Checks**

- `tests.html`: 22 of 22 pass. They cover voice votes, divisions with pairs and absences, the Speaker's tie, a loyalty change flipping a vote, a bill going first → second → report → third → passed with amendments at committee and report, skip only stopping where it should, a lost confidence vote setting the election flag, and three whole Parliaments played headless by a random bot in under a second.
- In the phone browser: skip to a vote, choose, and watch the count. No console errors.

**Things to know / decisions I made**

- **The government counts before confidence votes.** Without that, a minority government kept bringing budgets it would lose and fell in week one. Now, if it's short, it buys a smaller party's support with something for that party's ridings. That's a placeholder for stage 8's real confidence-and-supply deals. Parties that want an election refuse.
- **Divisions are called by parties.** A recorded division happens when a party opposes the question or members feel strongly. A few mild grumblers don't force one. Confidence votes are always recorded.
- **When a Parliament ends** (the government falls or four years pass), the game shows "Parliament is dissolved" and offers a new Parliament. Elections arrive in stage 8.
- **Calendar.** A year is 40 weeks: 31 sitting weeks and 9 constituency weeks, with votes Monday to Thursday. It's one string in `data/tuning.json` if you want a different rhythm.
- **How often you're stopped** depends on how well your riding fits your party: from almost never to about one vote every two weeks. `pacing.dilemmaThreshold` in tuning controls it.
