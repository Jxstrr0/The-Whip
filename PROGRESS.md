## 2026-10-21 · Stage 0: repo and pipeline

**What was built**

- `DESIGN.md` and `HANDOFF.md` committed from the two docs.
- `index.html` with the phone viewport tag, the Three.js `0.160.0` import map, and a full-screen canvas that ignores browser touch gestures so the game can use them.
- A placeholder scene: a slowly turning oak-and-green-leather desk under soft light, with the title underneath.
- `css/style.css` (dark theme, safe-area padding for notched phones), `src/main.js`, `.nojekyll`, `README.md` with the live link, and this file.

**Things to know**

- The repo is named `The-Whip` (capital T and W), so the live URL is **https://jxstrr0.github.io/The-Whip/**, not `/the-whip/` as the handoff says. Use the link in the README so the case matches the repo name.

**What you need to do in GitHub**

1. Open the repo, go to **Settings → Pages**.
2. Under **Build and deployment**, set Source to **Deploy from a branch**, pick **`main`** and **`/ (root)`**, and save.
3. Wait a minute or two, then open the live URL on your phone.

## 2026-10-21 · Stage 1: the chamber

**What was built**

- `src/chamber/layout.js`: pure maths for all 120 seats (side, row, seat number, position, facing). Seats `s001`–`s060` are the government side (the Speaker's right), `s061`–`s120` the opposition.
- `src/chamber/scene.js`: the room itself in simple shapes: green carpet, stepped rows, stone walls with tall windows, oak panelling, galleries along both long walls, the Speaker's dais and canopied chair, the Clerk's table with the Mace, and the brass bar.
- `src/chamber/seats.js`: every desk and chair drawn as one batch each (instancing), paired desks, and a pulsing gold ring on the selected seat.
- `src/chamber/camera.js`: one finger orbits (limited to ±60° sideways, 30°–75° from overhead), pinch zooms between 6 and 26 m, double-tap eases in to frame the seats around where you tapped. Mouse drag and wheel work on a computer.
- `src/chamber/picking.js`: a tap finds the seat under your thumb and shows a label with its id, side, row and seat number.
- `src/kit3d.js`: small shared helpers for building rooms out of boxes (not in the handoff's file list; the office, riding and caucus rooms will reuse it).

**Checks**

- Tested in a headless phone browser (Pixel 7 size, portrait and landscape): every on-screen seat was tapped and reported the right id (90 of 90; the other 30 are off the edge of a portrait screen until you turn the camera). Orbit, pinch and double-tap focus all respect the limits. No console errors.
- The whole chamber draws in 6 draw calls (budget is 60).
- **Still for you:** check it feels smooth on your phone with `?debug=1` (FPS counter, bottom left). The pixel ratio is capped at 2.

**Things to know / decisions I made**

- **Row spacing.** The handoff starts row 1 at 2.0 m from the aisle's edge, but four rows at 1.3 m spacing from there would put row 4 outside the 15 m-wide floor. I started row 1 at 1.0 m instead, which keeps the floor size and still clears the aisle. One number in `layout.js` if you want to change it.
- **Default camera outside the room.** The handoff's default camera spot (0, 9, 19) is outside the bar-end wall (the floor ends at 13). The walls and ceiling are one-sided, so you see straight through them from outside; nothing blocks the view.
- **Portrait lens.** On a portrait phone the camera widens its lens (up to 75°) so both sides of the aisle fit, instead of backing further out.
